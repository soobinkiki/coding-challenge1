# Coding Challenge (Penseive AI)

## Description
Developed the stikcy-notes that everyone can use and handle their notes.

## How to Install & Run Your Project
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Locate to the project folder.
3. `npm install -y` Run this command to install all of the dependencies 
  ("@material-ui/core": "^4.12.3", 
   "node-sass": "^6.0.1",
   "react-stickies": "^0.0.16").
4. `npm start` Run this command to run the app (The URL should be http://localhost:3000/ unless you are not using the port 3000).

## Notes
I couldn't complete the functionalites of creating/grouping the buckets since it's hard to customize with the pre-built React package for the sticky-notes ("react-stickies").
If I had more time, I wish I could start from scratch without using React package to be more flexible (To be honest, I was working on the internship project at the same time).
