# Coding Challenge (Penceive AI)

## Description
Developed the stikcy-notes that everyone can use and handle their notes.

## How to Install & Run Your Project
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Please locate to the project folder and run `npm install -y` to install all of the dependencies that are used for this project.
3. Now, you can run `npm start` to view on your local machine (The URL should be http://localhost:3000/ unless you are not using the port 3000)

## Notes
I had a limitation to meet all the requirements since I used the React package for the sticky-note which was pre-built, so it was a little hard for me to customize. To be honest, I was finishing up the project that I had during the internship so I couldn't really put 100% on this. If I had more time, I think I can start from scratch without using React package.
